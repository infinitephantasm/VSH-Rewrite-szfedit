# VSH-Rewrite, SZF edit
![logo](https://demon.girlsare.life/9W4166c.png)

an edit of the rewrite of Versus Saxton Hale created by 42 and several other contributors that aims to make the plugin work with Super Zombie Fortress, by removing/changing many bits and pieces of the code.

if it wasn't obvious, this thing sucks. do not actually use this for anything serious.

## Issues
- depending on the boss, weapon pickups can and will crash the server
- maps may function strangely if they do certain things based on map progress (mainly reducing health of players)
- balance issues. i don't intend on fixing them because why would you ever
- zombies have all melee weapon buffs/debuffs from VSH. take that for what you will.

## Requirements
- SourceMod 1.10
- [tf2attributes](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=210221)
- [tf_econ_data](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=315011)
- [dhooks with detour support](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2588686&postcount=589)
